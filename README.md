# webshopBackend

This webshop was built as a way for me to practice using React with Material UI, practice working with MongoDB, and to learn more about AWS services such as lambda. 

The front end can be found at [front end repo] (https://github.com/rockaflacka47/commerceShop) 

This repo is private due to not wanting to pay for this project more then necessary there are values that should be retrieved from AWS key management, or another provider, that are hard coded in. 

If you would like access to an admin account for the Add Item page please get in contact with me.
